     This method gets called when a background fetch happens. The app will have a limited amount of time to update itself in the background, so be careful on how you use this.
     When are done with this, you must call completionHandler with a suitable UIBackgroundFetchResult constant:
     * UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData if the app was able to successfully update itself.
     * UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData if the app did not have any additional data to update itself with.
     * UIBackgroundFetchResultFailed if the app failed to update for some reason.
     
     Be careful not to cache the completionHandler, although as shown in this example you can pass it through to the corresponding methods where you intend to do call it.
     
     Replace this implementation with whatever makes sense in your app.

    /*
     ** For the purposes of illustration in this particular example only**, consider the fetch successful only if the navigation controller's top view controller is the master table view controller. (You can then test the two scenarios by navigating from the master to the detail view controller.)
     * If the master view controller is the top view controller, invoke its insertNewObjectForFetchWithCompletionHandler: method. The insertNewObjectForFetchWithCompletionHandler: method takes as its argument the completion handler which is then invoked in the method with the argument UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData.
     * If the detail view controller is the top view controller, then pretend that the fetch failed and invoke the completion handler with the argument UIBackgroundFetchResultFailed.
     
     Important: Not shown here is a case where the background fetch didn't have new data to fetch. If the fetch fails in this way, you must call the completion handler with the argument UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData.
